INSTALL Process

# Install Instructions

## Prerequisites

- A VPS running Ubuntu or Debian.
- SSH access with private/public key authentication.
- Git installed on both local and server.


## Installation Steps (to be updated)
1. Clone the repository onto the VPS:

Set up the web server (Nginx or Apache) to serve content from the repository directory.

Configure SSH keys for secure access.

Create a Git hook or scheduled task to automatically pull changes.


Choices

Things I would say is that 
Nginx is easier to configure for static websites


Comparing the two I woud say:
- Apache has better built-in support for PHP
- Debian is lighter than Ubuntu but Ubuntu has more package support
