VPS Choice: DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean would be the best choice because...
- It is very easy to create VPS, it takes 1-2 minutes
- There are a ton of beginner tutorials which could guide us in our project for the upcoming weeks
- Out of all the other VPS we looked like Vultr, Linode, etc.. DigitalOcean has the best dashboard to help developers like us
  By Example:
    - Easy to choose OS
    - You can reboot, shut down and destroy the VPS with just 1 button click
    - You can view CPU, memory and bandwith usage in real time
    - Set up firewall rules, by example allowing only SSH or HTTP or HTTPS
- It supports automated backups, so if our server crashes, gets hacked or we made a huge mistake we can restore from the backup
- If we run out of storage, or server size, DigitalOcean provides help to it, but with a small additional cost

Only bad thing about DigitalOcean is that it is the most pricy VPS out of all we have researched, but it's still pretty cheap.
