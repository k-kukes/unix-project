# unix-project
Unix Project of Kukes Kanthasamy, Fahad Malik and Ethan Cole Hafso


Project Description
The aim of this project is to establish a GNU/Linux web server with automated deployment of websites. This process entails establishing a Virtual Private Server (VPS), implementing fundamental security measures, setting up the web server, and automating deployment: whenever a commit is made to the git repository, the website gets updated automatically. We will utilize a Public Domain license
 
Platform of Choice
We are using server as our platform choice.
Demonstration Plan
For the demonstration plan we will be using VPS.
Requirements
-          Basic system setup and security: Using SSH Keys instead of passwords
-          Process or service management/scheduling: Using systemd to boot up the server and restart the server if it crashes.  	
-          Automated tasks using a script language: GitHub pushing and commit/ updating the web server
Major technical solutions compared
This project will compare different web servers (Nginx vs Apache) and Ubuntu and Debian and deployment automation methods to determine the most efficient and reliable setup. The goal is to evaluate these options based on ease of configuration
Timeline
Week 1: Set up VPS and git repository and test the website using Nginx or Apache
